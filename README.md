# MSc-Thesis-Infimal-Convolution-TV-Curvelet

1.The function which runs the infimal convolution type functional is called 'TVCurvelets_21_8.m'.

2.The function which runs the the TV-only functional is called 'TV_only.m'.

3.The function which runs the curvelet-only functional is called 'Curvelets_only.m'.

4.To run these functions use the code 'TestingFunction'. Run the section of the functional you want. 
Make sure to adjust the parameters as you want before running the section.

5.For the parameters, keep u_solver as '1', keep mu as '20', keep non_negativity as '1'. 
These are all parameters I have not implemented fully yet, so keep them as this.
