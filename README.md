1.The function which runs the infimal convolution type functional is called 'TVCurvelets_21_8.m'.

2.The function which runs the the TV-only functional is called 'TVCurvelets_21_8.m'.

3.The function which runs the curvelet-only functional is called 'TVCurvelets_21_8.m'.T

4.To run these functions use the code 'TestingFunction'. Run the section of the functional you want.
